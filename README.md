# Amiga Assembly Game Programming Tutorial series

Hello,
I'm writing an Amiga game in assembly for myself and I thought that would be interesting to share the knowledge with other people.
The tutorials will be addressed to beginners, the only pre-requisite is the knowledge of Motorola 68000 Assembly language programming.


The tutorial contents are available in the [wiki section](https://github.com/stefanocoppi/amiga_game_prog/wiki)
